    "symptoms": "Preview displays a blank white screen",
    "environment": "Development mode using `vite`",

      "Supabase environment variables may not be properly configured",
      "Main entry point or routing might be misaligned",

  "steps": [
    "Check the `vite.config.ts` file to ensure the `root` and `base` paths are correctly set for Bolt's environment.",
    "Verify that all environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`) are accessible and loaded properly.",
    "Inspect the entry point (e.g., `src/main.tsx` or `src/index.tsx`) to ensure the React root is being rendered into a valid DOM element.",
    "Check for any unhandled runtime errors in the browser console or network errors in the DevTools.",
    "Review Tailwind CSS setup to confirm styles are being built and applied correctly. Rebuild styles if necessary.",
    "Test for issues in routing (e.g., React Router setup) that may result in the app loading without visible content.",
    "Provide debugging logs or a summary of fixes to ensure the application displays correctly in preview mode."
